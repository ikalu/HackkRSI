        <p>
          The university was chartered in 1828 by the Medical Society of Augusta as the Medical Academy of Georgia to address the need to train new physicians and offer a single course of lectures leading to a bachelor's degree. The doors of the Medical Academy of Georgia opened in Augusta’s City Hospital located on two and a half acres of land at 124 Greene Street. Teaching began in two rooms of the hospital in 1826 with seven students and three faculty members. The college began with three programs: Anatomy and surgery, institutes and practices of medicine, and diseases of women and children, and materia medica, chemistry, and pharmacy. The school received the right to award a bachelor of medicine degree after students attended one-year course of lectures and clinical training. The next year, December 1829 the governor signed a legislative act altering the charter of 1828 by expanding the curriculum to two years, culminating in a doctor of medicine degree, and changed the school’s name to the Medical Institute of Georgia. The first commencement was held April 7, 1833 with four students graduating.
          On December 20, 1833, the institution’s name was change to the Medical College of Georgia by the General Assembly to depict the school’s true status and mission, and for the next 80 years continued to operate with an emphasis on research and training physicians. 
          Old Medical College, a National Historic Landmark, was built in 1835 to serve as home to the Medical College of Georgia (MCG), the third-oldest medical college in the Southeast. Old Medical College is of national significance because of its impact on the medical instruction of physicians nationwide in the antebellum period and because its distinguished and well-trained faculty helped found the American Medical Association to regulate medical education standards. Located at 598 Telfair Street, the Old Medical College building was MCG’s first academic home. Designed by Charles B. Clusky, the original floor plans included a heating system, a laboratory on the western side of the building, a Roman cement facade, a skylight for the anatomy dissecting room and a grand hall down the center that divided two large lecture halls in the front area. An expansive rotunda and staircase divided the two grand halls. Construction lasted from 1834 to 1836. However, students and faculty moved into the unfinished building in January 1835. Construction costs totaled $14,567. In 1834, MCG sent Dr. Louis Alexander Dugas to Europe with $6,324 to purchase "an anatomical museum, chemical apparatus, and library." Starting in 1835, students had full use of the library. 
          During the deanship of Dr. Eve, the school expanded significantly and rapidly in matriculation of students. Between 1832 and 1840, the number of students grew from 27 to 54. This growth was marred by the death of the school’s founding father Dr. Antony in 1839 from yellow fever. Despite the loss, the school continued to prevail. By 1840, 100 students had graduated and were making names for themselves as competent physicians throughout Georgia and South Carolina.
          The faculty changes and the recurring financial troubles plagued the Board of Trustees during the early 1840s. Despite changes and hardships, the quality of education remained exemplary. While many medical schools had only demonstrations and lectures with little or no dissecting this situation was not the case at the MCG. Despite occasional cadaver shortages, rarely were students forced to forego dissecting because of a complete lack of subjects. With this hands-on learning, the instruction in anatomy was far superior to most medical schools in the country. By 1844, there were 39 graduates as compared to 18 in 1841, and the number of students had jumped from 73 to 140.
          The faculty purchased Grandison Harris, a slave from Charleston, S.C., in 1852 for $700. He worked for over 50 years for MCG as a janitor and resurrection man. 
          The college graduated 73 students in 1856, the largest class before the Civil War. After the 1859-1860 session, the faculty approved several improvements, such as cleaning the dissecting room and painting the exterior. The outbreak of the War led the school to close February 15, 1861, two weeks early. By October 1861, the events of the Civil War indicated to the remaining faculty and to the Board of Trustees that MCG would not open in the fall. Throughout the war, Confederate surgeons used the Medical College building as a headquarters and at times, it was also employed as a hospital
          After a four-year hiatus, the school reopened on the first Monday of November in 1865 with 47 students - 44 Southern students and three Northern soldiers. In August 1873, MCG became the Medical Department of the University of Georgia. During the session of 1875-76, several women attended chemistry lectures, marking the first appearance of females in MCG classes.
          During the session of 1881-1882, the Medical Department students uncharacteristically performed no dissections. The college instead relied on models for teaching. This problem was not unique to the Department, but to all medical schools in the United States. The school celebrated its 50th anniversary on commencement day Tuesday, February 28, 1882 at the Opera House.
          MCG faculty and trustees continued to take strides to ensure a first-rate education. In 1893, they developed a three-year curriculum with annual sessions of six months instead of five. This trend occurred nationwide as medical schools sought to improve physicians' education. The change went into effect in fall 1893, and required new students to take three courses instead of two. Enrolled students who already had completed one term were not required to take three courses.
          On March 6, 1912, the institution's board of trustees met for the last time. The school was now to be referred to solely as the Medical Department of the University of Georgia. When students departed for Christmas vacation in 1912, this event marked the last time medical classes were held in the 77 year old structure on Telfair Street. Many discoveries were made by faculty, inclnationwide as medical schools sought to improve physicians' education. The change went into effect in fall 1893, and required new students to take three courses instead of two. Enrolled students who already had completed one term were not required to take three courses.
          On March 6, 1912, the institution's board of trustees met for the last time. The school was now to from 1914 to 1926, after which the building stood vacant for five years. During the 1930s, it was used by civic and social organizations and housed a USO canteen during World War II. From 1948 until the late 1980s, the Sand Hills Garden Club preserved Old Medical College, and the Augusta Council of Garden Clubs later took it over. The space was used as an activity center for receptions, meetings, and banquets. The MCG Foundation began renovations to the building in 1988 as a conference and events center. The restored Old Medical College is referred to as the finest expression of the Greek Revival in Georgia. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1996.

           Ai in Action provides high school students in the Orangeburg, SC  community with a free after school course in probabilistic robotics. Our program exposes students to mathematics and computer science topics far beyond their high school curriculum. By completing a series of programming assignments students learn are equipped with the fundamentals of mobile robotics. The course rigor and variety prepares students to pursue any STEM discipline while giving each participant a robotics education they will not find anywhere else.
